There is no garanteed stipend by the programs, altough PhD students almost always receive grants or are hired by their research direction.

The university itself offers garanteed grants to all full time doctorate students (""bourse de soutien universel au doctorat""): https://bourses.uqam.ca/trouver-une-bourse/programme-de-bourses-de-soutien-universel-au-doctorat/ . It is 13 000$.

There are also some grants offered to some master students, but it is not for all of them. It gives 4000$: https://bourses.uqam.ca/trouver-une-bourse/bourses-institutionnelles-aux-cycles-superieurs/
Some  grants for master students are specifically offered to international students, to lower the cost of tuition: https://bourses.uqam.ca/trouver-une-bourse/bourses-detudes-droits-de-scolarite-majores/ . 

And of course there are institutionna grants for excellence, as well as a lot of paid research work available (but not garanteed).

I hope this will be usefull to you.

Most students receive more than the required minimum stipend amounts already.

The program of biology at UQAM imposes professors to pay a minimum stipends per student per year.
MSc = $12500 / PhD = $17000
Professors can ask for a maximum of one derogation. In biology, most professors pay their student more than this minimum (I would say the average is around $20000 before TAships, which means that students may be able to get around $25000 per year, they may also apply to institutional fellowships to get more money, and again whether the supervisors reduces their contribution or not depends on the professor).
UQAM also provides 13 000$ as an automatic institutional fellowship to every PhD student (5K 1st year ; 4k 2nd year ; 4K 3rd year). But professors can decide to include or not that amount in the minimum stipend described above.

•        If so, how many years is this stipend guaranteed for?
MSc = 2 years (6 terms) / PhD = 4 years (12 terms). There is no obligation, but most professors would extend the stipends if the student needs to extend their registration. 

•        What is the minimum value of this stipend (either gross or net of tuition)?
See above (gross).

•        Are students required to TA or RA on non-thesis-related work to attain this minimum level?
No. Students can choose to add TAships to this stipends. They generally do. 
I’ve heard some professors asked their students to do non-thesis-related research work, but I don’t think it’s the norm.

•        If TAing or RAing is required, how many hours per year (or week) does this entail?
We set a maximum number of TAships per year, because too much teaching could delay the thesis work. 

•        Does the department have any initiatives in place to mitigate higher tuition and healthcare costs for international students?
Yes. All the international PhD students (or the Canadian non Quebecer students) pay tuition fees that are equivalent to those of Quebec residents. That comes from an automatic tuition support from UQAM institution.
Unfortunately it’s not automatic for Master’s students, but UQAM’s Faculty of Science provides some fellowships per year to reduce tuition fees to the same level as Quebec students for the two years of the MSc.
If you want to get more information on tuition fees at UQAM: https://etudier.uqam.ca/cout-bourses
Every students who comes to Quebec, becomes a (temporary) Quebec resident and thus gets the provincial health care coverage.
I hope this will help. Thanks a lot for you actions! It’s really appreciated. I’ll try to change the content of the web page to add this type of information.
