# Canadian Minimum Stipends
Fraass, A.J. & Bailey, T., Karunakumar, K., & Wishart, A., Canadian natural science graduate stipends fall below the poverty line. PLOS One. Pre-print: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.06.622240v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.06.622240v1)

 This repository stores the data and code for the Canadian natural science graduate stipends publication. Code was written roughly equally by Bailey, Fraass, and Wishart. Canadian data was generated by the full team, while the US-based Biology data was provided by Gaynor, M. L. & Rautsaw, R. M. Biology Ph.D. Stipends.

If you are interested in pursuing similar research on different fields in Canada, we have plenty of advice to provide. Our project lived on Google Drive to assist in having shared documents for all participants. We used a [googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1STusmXjLqOZeInesHmFcUbIf_eWV9eDwFvfxobQ5LlE/edit?usp=sharing) to coordinate data collection between authors. A Machine Readable format can also be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1STusmXjLqOZeInesHmFcUbIf_eWV9eDwFvfxobQ5LlE/edit?usp=sharing). Our rubric can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GlK1olr5zNVpIMH_334DLFPaz7zSncTUPMPmBRTzooA/edit?usp=sharing), and an email template for contacting departments can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYrSrzgqeeNstAr_lJTT07-BGxKk4RpENx0IR-wo0uw/edit?usp=sharing). Strongly suggest to have a multi-person group engage in data collection, as it was a slow process that has an expiration date, given the nature of student stipends.
